<h1>Nicole's Socal Food Recommendations </h1>

<h2>Hi! My name is Nicole and I'm a food lover who loves to explore new restaurants, cafes, and hidden gems whenever I can. After visiting more than 25 spots over the past 2 years, I have accumulated a list of my top 5 spots that I think everyone should try. Enjoy! </h2>

<h3>1. Banh Cuon Luu Luyen - Garden Grove </h3>

<p>So yummy! Definitely one of my top spots in Socal. I got #5 nhân thịt and #11 bánh cuốn thịt nướng. #5 is my favorite and it always comes with yummy toppings; I just wish there were more toppings because they're all so good. The tofu can be a bit dry, but everything else makes up for it. The best way to eat it is by drowning it in fish sauce! Bánh cuốn is at the top 3 of my favorite foods, and this place does not disappoint! </p>

<h4>2. Luyu Dumplings - City of Industry </h4>

<p>Luyu Dumplings makes some of my favorite dumplings! I got #2 pork with leek dumplings, #2 chili spice mixed noodles, and C2 pan-fried pork buns, and all were 10/10. The dumplings were really flavorful, the pork buns were soft and tasty, and the noodles were also super good. I wanted to try the noodles at less spice, but I would definitely just recommend the regular level; I really like the garlic in the noodles, and it's not overpowering at all. </p>

<h5>3. Tacos Los Chollos - Anaheim </h5>

<p>I enjoy coming to Taco Los Chollos with my friends because they have an amazing taco pizza, called the Cholos Pizza. The pizza is topped plentiful with a hefty amount of meat, veggies, seasonings, and sauces. Most importantly, there's so much guacamole! The tortilla that serves as pizza crust is surprisingly really strong and holds everything well. There's a lot of cheese but it's not overpowering!</p>

<h6>4. Jinsol Gukbap - Buena Park </h6>

<div>

<p>Yum! Gukbap is pork soup and it reminded me of seolleongtang. I ordered the pork soup with Korean sausage and rice + leek pancake. Pork soup was yummy with rice; I can see how some people might think the soup is light, but you can add more salt if you'd like. The blood sausage was also good, and it tasted even better if you let it soak in the soup for a little bit. Leek pancake was fragrant and yummy, but super oily. The side dishes are very yummy! The kimchi was so refreshing and not salty, and the radish kimchi was nice and crunchy. I felt rejuvenated after eating and the meal wasn't that heavy, which was nice.</p>

<h7>5. Yeems Coffee - Los Angeles </h7>

<div>

<p>Yeems is my absolute favorite cafe and I drive an hour just to come here. I ordered the Vienna latte and it was so yummy! The coffee flavor was rich and it wasn't too sweet. I think it had a perfect amount of espresso flavor and the cream was delicious mixed in. Words cannot explain how much I love this drink, and it never fails to amaze me!</p>
